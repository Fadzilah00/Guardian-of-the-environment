    <td><h2>Humanising Marine Conservation - Sharing Our Love for Sharks and Rays at the Sabah Shark and Ray Initiative Showcase</h2>
       <p>By Serena Adam (Marine Conservation Officer, Shark) and Marina Aman Sham (Communicator, Short-Term Contract), Marine Programme, GOE Malaysia.

Unless you’re a marine life enthusiast, it’s likely that in terms of species identification, sharks and rays are lumped together as just that: sharks and rays. Can you tell the difference between a Smooth hammerhead and Great hammerhead (shark) at first glance?

The Guardians of Enviroment was amongst like-minded friends from the Sabah Shark and Ray Initiative (SSRI) who spent a weekend in June with a key goal in mind: to share our passion and love for sharks and rays (and all marine life, for that matter) with those who walked through the Tanjung Aru Marine Ecosystem (TAME) centre’s doors, in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. We welcomed school students from both local and international schools, alongside many others, who we hope gained much knowledge and had a lot of fun!</p></td>
